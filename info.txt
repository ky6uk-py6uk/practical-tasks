Desktop IDEs
The Eclipse IDE is famous for our Java Integrated Development 
Environment (IDE), but we have a number of pretty cool IDEs, 
including our C/C++ IDE, JavaScript/TypeScript IDE, PHP IDE, 
and more.

You can easily combine multiple languages support and other 
features into any of our default packages, and the Eclipse
 Marketplace allows for virtually unlimited customization and 
extension.

IDE Platforms
Create the next generation of developer tooling with our extensible platforms. Use your imagination to build services and tools that can be assembled into new IDEs or packages tailored to your identity. We provide multiple platforms to build plug-ins for desktop tools, distributed services used by cloud IDEs, and browser interfaces. You can then publish plug-ins to our Eclipse Marketplace of 1000s.
