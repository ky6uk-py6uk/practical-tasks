Desktop IDEs
The Eclipse IDE is famous for our Java Integrated Development 
Environment (IDE), but we have a number of pretty cool IDEs, 
including our C/C++ IDE, JavaScript/TypeScript IDE, PHP IDE, 
and more.

You can easily combine multiple languages support and other 
features into any of our default packages, and the Eclipse
 Marketplace allows for virtually unlimited customization and 
extension.
